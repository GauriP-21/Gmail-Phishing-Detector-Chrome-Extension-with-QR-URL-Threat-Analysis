A browser-based phishing detection system that scans Gmail emails in real-time to identify and flag malicious content. This project integrates machine learning, image processing, and threat intelligence APIs to detect both traditional phishing URLs and QR codeâ€“embedded phishing links. Built as a Chrome extension with a Flask-powered Python backend, the tool automatically classifies suspicious emails and moves them to a "Phishing" label in the user's inbox.
